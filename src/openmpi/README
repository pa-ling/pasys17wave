This is a minimalistic suggestion how a project could look like.
The build process is driven by a makefile.

The structure is as follows:
 - In core.c (you are free to change the name and to add other
   files) we implement the core functionality (e.g., algorithms).
 - In core_test.c (and possibly other files with _test.c suffix)
   we implement the unit tests as own executable programs without
   using a fancy unit testing framework (you are however, free
   to use one)
 - In <program_name>.c we implement the main driver of the
   program. This is the program that shall be invoked by the user.
 - The makefile contains all flags and rules to build the program
   and tests and rules how to run the test. Important targets are
   "all", "build", "test", and "clean".

Feel free to adapt this layout for your own needs.
